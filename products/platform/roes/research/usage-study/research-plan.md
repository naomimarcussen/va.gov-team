**Research Plan for Rules of Engagement (ROE)**

**Goals**
Our goal is to define user research-based requirements for a template to document ROEs that establish how VFS and VSP teams interact throughout the product development lifecycle.   

Background: 
* VSP teams currently organically develop and document ROEs. 
* ROE documentation in Github and Zenhub (as of 10/9) 

Insights we hope to derive in asking these questions:
* Do people know ROEs exist for their practice area?
* Can people find them when they need them?
* How do people find them today?
* What information is useful in an ROE (per practice area)?
* Are teams who follow them more likely to exhibit the behavior we want?
* What will make teams more likely to find and follow the ROE’s?
* Are VSP Team members fluent on ROEs across all areas, and thus know how VSP functions as a whole? Would people be able to say “oh, that’s not the way we do it here” if they saw a VFS team doing something that’s not aligned with our ROE?
* What practice areas still need to create an ROE?

**Hypothesis**
* ROE documents are providing VFS teams with relevant, valuable information.
* ROEs help teams operate in alignment with VSP objectives.

**Method**
* 8 remote interviews with 4 VFS teams, 2 people from each 
  * Tool: Zoom to record
* Survey VPS team members regarding ROE documents.
  * Tool: Optimal Sort

We will use surveys to measure the gaps in understanding and completion of ROE documents.  Interviews will allow us to ask followup questions and gain a deep understanding of the effectiveness of ROEs throughout the VFS user journey. 
 
**Research Questions**
Interview questions for VFS team members:

For people who are NEW to VA.gov
* Have you worked with ROEs before?
  * If yes, were they helpful?
* Are you aware that an ROE for your practice area exists? 
  * If yes, do you use them?
* Have you gone back to refer to it at any point in the process?
* Was it helpful? Did you find what you were looking for? 
* What would you add or change, if anything?
* Do you feel that having this document helped the process go more smoothly with the VSP team? How?

For people who HAVE worked on VA.gov for a long time
* Have you worked with ROEs before?
  * If yes, were they helpful?
* Are you aware that an ROE for your practice area exists? 
  * If yes, do they use them?
* What have you done differently since the ROEs were established?
* Have you gone back to refer to it at any point in the process?
* Was it helpful? Did you find what you were looking for? 
* What would you add or change, if anything?
* Do you feel that having this document helped the process go more smoothly with the VSP team? How?
